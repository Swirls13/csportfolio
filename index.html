  <p class="bio">Hi there, My name is Ariel Lee. I go to the highschool Summit Shasta and I'm a freshman. One of my favorite habbies is drawing. I usually spend a lot of my time drawing or animating at home.</p>
    <p class="bio"> I first started drawing when I was in middle school. During the 7th grade, my teacher had us draw a lot for homework and projects. This pushed me to get better at drawing so I can do my best when I worked on these projects. I also got inspired by the TV shows I liked to watch at the time. All of these made me want to do better in my drawings and imrpove the way I drew. </p>
