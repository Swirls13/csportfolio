<u class="h1"><h1 class="idk">Hardware</h1></u>
<h2 class="idk"><em>Motherboard</em></h2>
<p class="idk">What is a motherboard?</p>
<p class="idk">A motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer. It's a printed circuit board that contains the principal components of a computer. It allocates power to the CPU, RAM, and all other computer hardware. The role of the motherboard is to allow hardware components to communicate with one another.</p> 
<p class="idk">Motherboards usually contain the CPU, BIOS, memory, mass storage interfaces, serial and parallel ports, expansion slots, and all the controllers required to control standard peripheral devices. The motherboard also contains connectors that attach to additonal boards.</p>
<img src="http://i847.photobucket.com/albums/ab32/flint117/motherboard.png:original" alt="Picture of a CPU. Front and Back View" width="300" height="200">
<p class="idk">Some of the important components in the motherboard are:</p>
<li class="idk">Processor Socket - the central piece of a motherboard, which holds the processor (aka the "brain" of the computer)</li>
<li class="idk">Power Connectors - the power supply’s main connector gets attached, which provides power to the motherboard and all the other components.</li>
<li class="idk">Memory Slots - memory slots are used to house the computer’s memory</li>
<li class="idk">Video Card Slot - the slot used for video cards</li>
<li class="idk">Expansion Slots - lets you install additional components to enhance or expand the functionality of your PC</li>
<li class="idk">IDE and SATA Ports - provides connectivity for the storage devices and optical drives</li>
<li class="idk">BIOS Chip and Battery - contains the basic code needed to take your computer through the boot process, up to the point where the operating system takes over</li>
<li class="idk">Northbridge and Southbridge - provide thermal protection for the Northbridge – one of the most important components of a motherboard</li>
<li class="idk">Front Panel Connectors, USB Headers and Audio Header - where all the elements present on the front of your case are connected</li>
<li class="idk">Rear Connectors - the bridge between the outside of your computer and the inside</li>
<p class="idk"><u>TO the right is a picture of a motherboard</u></p>
<h2 class="idk"><em>CPU</em></h2>
<p class="idk">What is a CPU?</p>
<p class="idk">The CPU is an acronym for Central Processing Unit. It's known as the "brains" of the comupter. It's one of the most important elements in the comupter system because it's where most of the calculations take place.</p>
<img src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/OwtdFn43P2XoKMdGvR8Six-Kd6SO18VP7_Iay5rQNEF2zXKguqN2Wa7U3n2QNeN9wQ=w300" alt="Picture of a CPU. Front View" width="300">
<p class="idk">The CPU needs one or more printed curcuit boards when it comes to larger machines. For personal computers, the CPU is usually in a single chip called the microprocessor. The microprocessor class of the CPU has almost completely overtaken all other CPU implementations.</p>
<p class="idk">The CPU is an internal part of the computer and CPUs today are small, square, and have many metallic connectors or pins on its underside. It's insterted into a CPU socket, whcih is on the mother board. The motherboard only supports specific types of CPUs, so always make sure to check it before you try to replace or upgrade it.</p>
<p class="idk">There are two typical components in a CPU:</p>
<li class="idk">arithmetic logic unit - performs arithmetic and logical operations</li>
<li class="idk">control unit - extracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes them</li>
<p class="idk"><u>To the right is a picture of a CPU</u></p>
<h2 class="idk"><em>RAM</em></h2>
<p class="idk">What is a RAM?</p>
<img src="http://www.wpclipart.com/computer/hardware/memory/ddr_ram_T.png" alt="Picture of a RAM. front View" width="300">
<p class="idk">The RAM is an acronym for Random Access Memory. A RAM is a type of computer memory that can be randomly accessed. It is a hardware device that allows information to be stored and retrieved on a computer. It's the most common type of memory found in computers and other devices. </p>
<p class="idk">There are two types of RAMs:</p>
<li class="idk">DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) - The DRAM is more common, but needs to be refreshed a lot. DRAM also supports access times of about 60 nanoseconds.</li>
<li class="idk">SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) - The SRAM isn't used as often as the DRAM because it's more expensive. Though, it is a lot better becasue it a lot more faster so you dont need to refesh it. It can also ive access times as low as 10 nanoseconds</li>
<p class="idk"><u>To the right is a picture of a RAM</u></p>
<h2 class="idk"><em>Hard Drive</em></h2>
<p class="idk">What is a Hard Drive?</p>
<p class="idk">Hard drive is actual one of the abbreviations for Hard Disk Drive. A hard drive is a device that is used to permanently store and recieve information. Hard drives usually consists of one or more platters on which data is written by using a magnetic head.</p>
<img src="http://www.techspot.com/images2/downloads/topdownload/2015/01/harddrive.png" alt="Picture of a Hard Drive. front View" width="300">
<p class="idk">Data can be sent and and from the hard drive. The data helps tell the hard drive what to do and how to move the components in the drive. When the operating system needs to read or write information, it will have to read the hard drive's File Allocation Table (FAT) to determine file location and available write areas. Since the files are often scattered throughout the platter, the head needs to move to different locations to access all the information.</p>
<p class="idk">Even though most of the hard drives are internal, there are actually some hard drives called "external hard drives". Those types of hard drives can backup data on computers and expand the available disk space. External hard drives can be very useful because they usually offer more space than a jump drive while still being portable.</p>
<p class="idk"><u>To the right is a picture of a Hard Drive</u></p>
<h2 class="idk"><em>Keyboard, Mouse, and Monitor</em></h2>
<p class="idk">What is a Keyboard?</p>
<img src="http://www.qpad.com/uploads/images/Shop-Template/Keyboards/MK85/mk85-overviuew-main.png" alt="Picture of a Keyboard. front View" width="300">
<p class="idk">A keyboard is a set of typewriter-like keys that lets you enter data into a computer or other devices. A computer keyboard is similar to electric-typewriter keyboard, but contains additional. Typical keys found on a keybaord are:</p>
<li class="idk">Alphanumeric keys - letters and numbers on the keyboard.</li>
<li class="idk">Punctuation keys - the comma, period, semicolon, and similiar keys.</li>
<li class="idk">Special keys - function keys, control keys, arrow keys, caps Lock key, and so on.</li>
<p class="idk"><u>To the right is a picture of a Keyboard</u></p>
<p class="idk">What is a Mouse?</p>
<img src="http://theartmad.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Computer-Mouse-Transparent-Background-1.png" alt="Picture of a Mouse" width="130" height="100">
<p class="idk">A mouse is an input device. The mouse sends information to the computer with just a click of a button. It's used an alternative way to interact with a computer besides the use of a keyboard. There are two buttons on a mouse, a left and right button that allows you to click on items on the comupter. In the middle of the two buttons, there's a scrolling wheel, which helps move up and down that pages easier.</p>
<p class="idk"><u>To the right is a picture of a Mouse.</u></p>
<img src="http://briancarper.net/random/monitor.png" alt="Picture of a Mouse" width="130" height="100">
<p class="idk">What is a Monitor?</p>
<p class="idk">A monitor is a piece of the computer hardware that displays video and graphics information that is generated by the computer through the video card. Monitors are similar to televisions but can display information at a high resolution. A monitor connects to either an HDMI, DVI, or VGA port on the computer.</p>
<p class="idk">Before, computer monitors were used for data processing. Then in 1980, monitors have been used for data processing.</p>
<p class="idk"><u>To the right is a picture of a Monitor.</u></p>
<h2 class="idk"><em>How do the different components communicate with one another?</em></h2>
<p class="idk">Although computers communicate on many different levels, the basic communication process is relatively uniform and standardized. Computers communicate with one another over networks that are connected through wire or wireless communication methods. There are many different types of networks, and there are many different types of network-connections as well. The most common network types are personal area network, local area network, campus area network, metropolitan area network, wide area network, global area network and internetworks. The difference between these networks are their methods of connections.</p>
<p class="idk">There are many different types of connection media that are used to connect computer networks to one another. There are wired connections like coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable, USB cable and traditional telephone lines. The most commonly used network connections today are wireless like bluetooth and wifi.</p>
